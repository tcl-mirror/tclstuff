Promises

(p {This module provides the "force" command which evaluates a script
    and then saves the result inside the object so that next time it's
    called with the same object it can give a result without
  evaluating the script again.})

(p {Note that the usage of the word "promise" here follows the
    terminology of Scheme's lazy evaluation facility, and has nothing
  to do with concurrency.})

(p {Good practice suggests only using this command on idempotent
  scripts with no side effects.})

 {. File exports a single function: } (code {void lazyInit(Tcl_Interp *)})
 {, which registers the "force" command.})
