Memoization

(p
 (b style={color:red} {UPDATE: }) {The } (code {memoize})
 { command has been replaced by } (code {memo})
 {. Calling } (code {memo a b c}) { has the same effect as directly calling }
 (code {a b c}) {. The intrep of } (i {c}) { will contain pointers to the command prefix it was
   last called with (a and b). If they haven't change, the previous result is returned.})

(p {This module provides the "memoize" command which takes an
  existing command (or, more precisely, a command prefix list),
  and registers another command that gives the same result as the
  original (but see restrictions below) and caches the result in
  its argument object to speed up repeated calls.})

(p
 {Usage: memoize } (i {cmd original}) { ?} (i {arg}) {...?})
  
(p {A few caveats apply here. First, the original command should be
      referentially transparent and free of side effects. Otherwise
      the original procedure and the memoized version will not behave
      identically.})

(p {Second, this is not memoization in the technical sense, because
      the caching here is based on object identity (pointer value). In
      Tcl, pointer equality is sufficient for string equality across
  time (thanks to copy-on-write), but not necessary.})

(p {"Real" memoization, given Tcl's EIAS (everything is a string)
      semantics, would be looking up the value in a hash
      table. However, if the original procedure obeys the restrictions
      in the above paragraph, there will be no observable difference
      between our memoization and "real" memoization.})

(h2 {Rationale})

(p {If you look at the C code, you'll see that the
      implementation for memoization closely resembles the
  implementation of }
 (a href={promise.html} {promises}) {.})

(p {Where memoization is helpful is when you want separate the
      operating procedure from the data and still cache the result,
      which is not possible with "force".})
