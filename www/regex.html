  does not convert strings to Unicode in order to match. I implemented this matcher as part of my <a href="utf8mode.html">Tcl Unicode reorganization</a>. <b>NOTE:</b> see section &quot;Restrictions&quot; below.</p><p> The best source that I&apos;ve come across for writing regular
      expressions matchers is Russ Cox&apos;s fantastic <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/">series of articles</a>. The implementation here closely follows his guides.</p><p> One point worth pointing out that Cox only alludes to in his
      articles is the recursive behavior of addthread (called &quot;follow&quot;
      in my code). He notes that, in order to schedule threads in the
      correct order for the next round to prioritize SPLIT&apos;s first
      destination, addthread should process jumps recursively and add
      all immediately reachable threads eagerly.</p><p> In practice, if you read his code you discover that addthread
      also processes SAVE. This is because a jump might occur after
      the SAVE, and if so, that jump destination should also be
      scheduled immediately.</p><p> I&apos;ve generalized this notion to make a clearer (to me) split
      between the &quot;execute&quot; and &quot;addthread&quot; (renamed &quot;follow&quot;)
      loops. Now follow will always advance as far as possible, even
      handling MATCH instructions, until it becomes clear that it
      needs to read another character from the matched string, at
      which point it cedes control back to execute.</p><p> This leaves only three instructions for the execute loop itself:
      CHR, ANY, and BRACKET (the last one not implemented in Cox&apos;s
      sample code). Before reading the first character, and after
      that, after reading every single character, it calls follow to
      advance the match as far as possible without reading input.</p><p> Another difference is that execute also informs follow whether it
      has reached the end of the input. This way follow can process
      the END instruction, and also drop a thread when no match has
      been found rather than return to execute, upon end of input.</p><p> This division emphasizes the principle that the threads run in
      lockstep in regards to consuming characters; while looping
      through the thread list, the only decision to make is whether to
      continue the thread or drop, given the current character. All
      logic to process individual threads beyond that is handled by
      follow.</p><p> The invariant that every thread scheduled will be ready to
      consume a character also simplifies the code a little.</p><h2>Implementation notes</h2><p> This regex implementation is split into two parts. The front end,
      in Tcl, parses (using <a href="combinators.html">combinators</a>) and compiles regexes to a compact (especially
      compared to Cox&apos;s sample code) bytecode representation. The
      backend, written in C, only executes bytecode.</p><p> The compiler procedure is <a href="memo.html">memoized</a> so
  compilation only occurs once for each static occurence of a regular
  expression.</p><p> Before execution, the C engine will verify that the bytecode is
      safe to run&mdash;for eample, that it won&apos;t cause access to
      out-of-bounds memory. After validation the bytecode along with
      some summary information useful for execution (number of
      instructions, maximum slot value, etc.) will be stored in the
      internal representation of the object.</p><p> Whereas Cox&apos;s compiler directly outputs code in one pass,
      patching jump addresses as soon as they become available, this
      regex first converts the AST to an intermediate representation
      silimar to continuation-passing style. The regex compiler in Tcl
      then performs a couple of simple optimizations. First, jumps to
      jumps are eliminated. Then, it will try to combine basic blocks
      into &quot;traces&quot;&mdash;sorting basic blocks in such a way that
      a jump is immediately followed by its label so that the jump can
      be deleted.</p><p> Another (tiny) optimization is that, for (re)*, rather than
      generating a SPLIT instruction and then looping back to the
      first SPLIT, we duplicate the SPLIT.</p><h2>Restrictions</h2><p>This is only a proof-of-concept implementation, not production quality. The following
   features are missing:<ul><li>Named bracket character classes (\d, \s, and \w are supported).</li><li>The regsub command (soon).</li></ul>The following are intentional incompatibilities which, while
   negotiable, don&apos;t interest me personally so probably
   won&apos;t get implemented unless I receive a patch (notably,
   all features that make expressions non-regular are
   omitted&mdash;this matcher will always match in linear time):<ul><li>Treating non-ASCII characters as anything other than just another character.
    For example, \d only matches [0-9].
  </li><li>The whole \A\Z vs. ^$ split. In this regex \A and \Z are
    simply synonyms for ^ and $, and newline is never treated
    specially (so no -line, -linestop, -lineanchor).</li><li>Case-insensitive matching.</li><li>Positive and negative lookaheads (useful&mdash;regular or not?)</li><li>Words and word boundaries ([[:&gt;:]], \m, \M, \y, \Y).</li><li>Backreferences (highly irregular)</li><li>Insignificant whitespace in regexes.</li><li>Compilation options and flags&mdash;this regex essentially
    parses what re_syntax(n) calls AREs, minus omissions noted
    on this list.</li></ul></p><p>In addition, this regex will currently not run with the default 16-bit Tcl_UniChar
  (see <a href="utf8mode.html">here</a> for an explanation), though it would be easy to port.</p><h2>Downloads</h2><p>C source: <a href="regex.c.txt">regex.c.txt</a>, Tcl source: <a href="regex.tcl.txt">regex.tcl.txt</a>.
