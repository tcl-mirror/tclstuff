    and then saves the result inside the object so that next time it&apos;s
    called with the same object it can give a result without
  evaluating the script again.</p><p>Note that the usage of the word &quot;promise&quot; here follows the
    terminology of Scheme&apos;s lazy evaluation facility, and has nothing
  to do with concurrency.</p><p>Good practice suggests only using this command on idempotent
  scripts with no side effects.</p><h2>Download</h2><p>C source: <a href="lazy.c.txt">lazy.c.txt</a>. File exports a single function: <code>void lazyInit(Tcl_Interp *)</code>, which registers the &quot;force&quot; command.</p></body></html>
