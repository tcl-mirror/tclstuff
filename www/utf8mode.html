  directly on the UTF-8 representation of strings
  rather than first converting to Unicode. This saves space and
  allows the use of full multi-plane Unicode.</p><p>You can find the Fossil repository <a href="http://chiselapp.com/user/stefank/repository/tcl">here</a>. Please excuse the mega-commit; I started off directly editing the source from the 8.6.5 tarball. Also,
   the state of the repo is sometimes out-of-date compared with trunk Tcl.</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> this is a proof of concept. See below for issues.</p><h2>The problem</h2><p> While strings in Tcl start off as UTF-8, most string procedures
      will decode strings to Unicode and save both representations
      inside the string object, using a 16-bit array to hold the
      Unicode characters. Or more specifically, an array of
      Tcl_UniChar. 16 bits used to be enough to hold any Unicode
      character, but this is no longer the case today. Practically,
      this means Tcl cannot handle Unicode characters outside of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29#Basic_Multilingual_Plane">BMP</a>. The recent popularity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji">emojis</a> on mobile platforms has thrown this issue into sharp relief.</p><h2>TCL_UTF_MAX and Tcl_UniChar</h2><p> It is possible to gain access to the extended Unicode characters
      by setting the C preprocessor definition TCL_UTF_MAX to four or
      six (up from a default of three) before including
      tcl.h. However, this introduces a couple of issues. First, this
      breaks binary compatibility with compiled Tcl
      extensions. Second, this setting also changes the base type of
      Tcl_UniChar to 32 bits, greatly expanding the storage used for
      strings.</p><p> For ASCII strings, a string with cached Unicode representation
      now uses five times as much space as one without, compared to
      three times with 16-bit Tcl_UniChar. And in mainline Tcl almost
      all string operations will cache the string&apos;s Unicode
      representation.</p><p>My solution: set TCL_UTF_MAX to 6 (but see section &quot;Future
      Improvements&quot; below) and stop caching decoded Unicode data.</p><h2>The Indexing Issue</h2><p>The goal of expanding Unicode range while keeping down storage
  requirements clashes with the pervasive assumption in Tcl&apos;s C
  and Tcl codebase that strings permit direct indexing using
  Unicode character positions.</p><p>As a compromise, in my version, the String internal
  representation structure contains a byte position-character
  position pair, know as the &quot;cursor&quot;, which maintains a
  single valid index into the UTF-8 string. Indexing by an
  arbitrary character position involves first moving the cursor to
  the requested location and then reading. This method minimizes
  the work done when accessing strings in mostly linear order.</p><h2>Changes to Tcl</h2><p>Since we no longer hold onto the Unicode representation of
  strings, uses of Tcl_GetUnicode and Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj now
  leak memory, and I have been removing these uses. I introduced
  two new public functions, tentatively named
  Tcl_GetStringFromCharAt (retrieve char pointer from Tcl_Obj
  given character position&amp;mdash;this functionality is not
  possible in vanilla Tcl without counting from the start of the
  string) and Tcl_NewStringObjWithCharLength (create string object
  and set its Unicode character length without checking), to help
  with this effort.</p><p>So far, I&apos;ve converted &quot;string compare&quot;, &quot;string first&quot;, &quot;string index&quot;, &quot;string
range&quot;, and associated VM operations.</p><p>Certain procedures, for example &quot;string last&quot; and &quot;string map&quot;, currently leak memory.</p><p>A major offender is regexp. I modified regexp to free Unicode
  data it requests but now running regexp on a large string
  repeatedly will decode and dispose the string&apos;s Unicode
  representation many times. As a semi-solution, I have written a <a href="regex.html">new regular expressions facility</a>  which operates on UTF-8 directly.</p><h2>Future Improvements</h2><p>Some possible improvements:<ul><li>Rather than keeping a single cursor, use some sort of tree
    structure to maintain references into the string, so that
    indexing into the string is logarithmic in length of string,
    at worst, while using drastically less memory than saving
    full UTF-32.</li><li>Alternatively, go one step further and implement the String
    internal rep on top of a rope data structure or similar.</li><li>Hold onto result of Tcl_GetUnicode. Free old value when a
    new one is requested, and when string is deleted. Uses will
    still be slow but this will at least close the memory leak.</li><li>Decouple UTF_TCL_MAX and size of Tcl_UniChar. Operate on
    full Unicode with UTF-8 data, UCS-2 (UTF-16 without propert
    surrogate pair handling, essentially) with
    Tcl_GetUnicode-derived data. Regain binary compatibility put
    possibly fatally inconsistent when given Unicode data
    outside of BMP.</li></ul></p></body></html>
