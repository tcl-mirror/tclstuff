  operate on records with named fields--or &quot;structures&quot; in some
  languages. I use records to bundle data into a single value where
  I would otherwise use a Tcl array, a
  dict/<a href="critbit.html">tree</a>, or a plain list.</p><p>The idea behind implementing this facility in C is to give field
    selectors an internal representation that makes working with
  records about as fast as directly using lindex and lset.</p><h2>Usage</h2><table boder=0><tr><td style="background:#dcdcdc">: <i>recValue field</i></td><td>Select <i>field</i> from record.</td></tr><tr><td style="background:#dcdcdc">: <i>varName field value</i></td><td>Set field <i>fiel</i> to given value in record stored in variable <i>varName</i>.</td></tr></table><h2>Format</h2><p>A record is a list whose first element is a list of field
    names. The remaining elements correspond to the named
    fields. Extra elements are ignored (but see section &quot;Properties&quot;
    below) while not having enough elements for the field list is an
    error.</p><p>For example, <code>: {{a b c} 1 2 3} a</code> gives &quot;1&quot;.</p><h2>Performance Characteristics</h2><p>The first time an object is used as a field selector, the field
    list is searched to give an index. The index is then stored inside
    the object, along with the interned field name, to speed up
    subsequent access. The field selector&apos;s internal representation is
    also replaced with an array of interned field names.</p><p>Crucially, a cached field selector does not depend on any
    particular field list object. When used, it simply verifies that
    the index is within range, and that the field list has the same
    field at that index (a pointer comparison). The symbol table for
  interned field names is global to the interpreter.</p><p>This has a few implications. First, if you create records in
    different places with different instances of literal strings that
    spell the same field list, field access will be just as fast as if
    the records&apos; field lists were the same object/literal
    string. Meaning there&apos;s no requirement to have a single
  constructor procedure for each record type.</p><p>Second, this makes it easy to create compatible extensions to
    record types. For example, if you have a set of procedures that
    expect a record with field list &quot;A B&quot;, you can pass in a record
    with field list &quot;A B C D&quot; with no impact on performance, since all
  fields will be found at the expected indices.</p><h2>Properties</h2><p>As mentioned previously, the C command (&quot;:&quot;, or whatever you
    decide to name it) ignores elements in the record list past the
  named fields.</p><p>I use the element after the final field to store a <a href="critbit.html">tree</a> containing additional named
   fields, or &quot;properties&quot; (Lispers will recognize plists here).<a href="util.tcl.txt">Here</a> is some Tcl code to get and set
   record properties (search for &quot;rec_prop&quot;). An absent property map is treated as empty.</p><h2>Download</h2><p>C source: <a href="record.c.txt">record.c.txt</a>(entry point: recordObjCmd), Tcl code for properties: <a href="util.tcl.txt">util.tcl.txt.</a></p></body></html>
